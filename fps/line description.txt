1. authentification.py
on line 1 and 2 there are imports 
    * seiral for serial commuication
    * struct for conveting data to buffers
    * datetime for time control
    * time for timestamp control
    * sys for communication with the system

ser = serial.Serial("COM6", 9600, timeout=1) : 
    declaration of a type ser wich is gonna help us to make serial communication
    com6 is the serialport name
    9600 is the braudRate
    timeout is the max time of an empty communication
